# Problem 1

First we load in the Mr. Wheel Data

``` r
#read & clean data from sheet 1 mr. wheel
wheel_data = read_excel(
  path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx",
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = cell_cols(1:14) #don't read last column
  ) %>% 
  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(dumpster != "NA") %>% #omit non-dumpster # rows
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) #round

#read & clean precip data 2018
precip_18 = read_excel(
  path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2018 Precipitation" ,
  skip = 1 #skip first row (header)
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

#read & clean precip data 2017
precip_17 = read_excel(
  path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
  sheet = "2017 Precipitation" ,
  skip = 1 #skip first row (header)
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017")
  
#now combine 2017 + 2018 precip data into one
precip_17_18 = bind_rows(precip_17, precip_18) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) #spell out month names
```

## Discussion

We used the “Mr. Trash Wheel Data” to create a dataframe called
`wheel_data`. It should be noted that in creating & cleaning this
dataset, we excluded the non-dumpster-specific rows, namely the monthly
totals.

The resulting dataset `wheel_data` has 285 rows and 14 columns.

The greatest amount of trash by weight that Mr. Trash Wheel picked up in
one dumpster was 5.62 tons, which occurred on 2015-05-17 in Dumpster
Number \# 62. Not surprisingly, this also corresponded to the highest
number of homes powered from one dumpster, which was about 94 homes.

By volume, the greatest amount was 20 yards<sup>3</sup>, which occurred
on 2014-08-13 in Dumpster Number \# 27.

Next we read in the precipitation data from 2017 and 2018 (note that we
only have data through July 2018). We then combined these nicely into a
dataframe `precip_17_18`, which has 19 rows and 3 columns.

The total precipitation in 2018 through July was 23.5 inches of rain.

The median number of sports ball in a dumpster in 2017 was 8 balls.
