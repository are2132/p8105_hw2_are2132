# Problem 1

First we load in the Mr. Wheel Data

``` r
#read & clean data from sheet 1 mr. wheel
wheel_data = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols(1:14) #don't read last column
  ) %>% 
  
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(dumpster != "NA") %>% #omit non-dumpster rows
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)) #round

#read & clean precip data 2018
precip_18 = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation" ,
    skip = 1 #skip first row (header)
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2018")

#read & clean precip data 2017
precip_17 = 
  read_excel(
    path = "./hw2 data/trash_wheel_data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation" ,
    skip = 1 #skip first row (header)
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(year = "2017")
  
#now combine 2017 + 2018 precip data into one
precip_17_18 = 
  bind_rows(precip_17, precip_18) %>% 
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) #spell out month names
```

## Discussion

We used the “Mr. Trash Wheel Data” to create a dataframe called
`wheel_data`. It should be noted that in creating & cleaning this
dataset, we excluded the non-dumpster-specific rows, namely the monthly
totals.

The resulting dataset `wheel_data` has 285 rows and 14 columns.

The greatest amount of trash by weight that Mr. Trash Wheel picked up in
one dumpster was 5.62 tons, which occurred on 2015-05-17 in Dumpster
Number \# 62. Not surprisingly, this also corresponded to the highest
number of homes powered from one dumpster, which was about 94 homes.

By volume, the greatest amount was 20 yards<sup>3</sup>, which occurred
on 2014-08-13 in Dumpster Number \# 27.

Next we read in the precipitation data from 2017 and 2018 (note that we
only have data through July 2018). We then combined these nicely into a
dataframe `precip_17_18`, which has 19 rows and 3 columns.

The total precipitation in 2018 through July was 23.5 inches of rain.

The median number of sports ball in a dumpster in 2017 was 8 balls.

# Problem 2

First we read in and tidy the pols data

``` r
pols_month = 
  read_csv(file = "./hw2 data/538_data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #break up date into 3 columns
  separate(col = mon, into = c("year","month","day"), 
           sep = "-", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  
  #spell out months
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  

  #create new column "president", initialize as gop col
  mutate(president = prez_gop) %>% 
  
  #replace gop = 0 values with "dem"
  mutate(president = 
           replace(president, president == 0, "dem")) %>% 
  #replace remaining (gop nonzero) values with "gop"
  mutate(president = 
           replace(president, president!="dem", "gop")) %>%
 
  #delete 3 columns
  select(-c(prez_dem,prez_gop,day))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

Next we read in and tidy the snp data

``` r
snp_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./hw2 data/538_data/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  
  #break up date into 3 columns
  separate(col = date, into = c("month","day","year"), 
           sep = "/", convert = TRUE) %>% 
  
  #arrange by date
  arrange(year, month) %>% 
  
  #spell out months
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
  
  #get rid of day column
  select(-day) %>% 
  
  #order so cols = year then month
  select(year, everything())
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   date = col_character(),
    ##   close = col_double()
    ## )

Finally we read in and tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemploy_data = 
  read_csv(file = "./hw2 data/538_data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    jan:dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemploy_rate"
  )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   Year = col_double(),
    ##   Jan = col_double(),
    ##   Feb = col_double(),
    ##   Mar = col_double(),
    ##   Apr = col_double(),
    ##   May = col_double(),
    ##   Jun = col_double(),
    ##   Jul = col_double(),
    ##   Aug = col_double(),
    ##   Sep = col_double(),
    ##   Oct = col_double(),
    ##   Nov = col_double(),
    ##   Dec = col_double()
    ## )

Now let’s combine the datasets into one

``` r
stepping_stone = left_join(pols_month, snp_data)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
final_data538 = left_join(stepping_stone, unemploy_data)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")
